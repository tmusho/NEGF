This program is a quantum transport code to determine the full thermoelectric figure of merit for 1D nanostuctured thermoelectric materials (ex. superlattice materials). A non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) method is used based on Landau-Buttiker formulism to predict the transport properties. 

The code was written to run in parallel using MPI. To run the code using electron phonon scattering two codes must be executed simultaneously and information is passed through a text files between the two codes.
